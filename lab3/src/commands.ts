 * This operation must be able to interleave with other operations, so while a map() is in progress,
 * other operations like look() and flip() should not throw an unexpected error or wait for the map() to finish.
 * But the board must remain observably pairwise consistent for players: if two cards on the board match 
 * each other at the start of a call to map(), then while that map() is in progress, it must not
 * cause any player to observe a board state in which that pair of cards do not match.
 *
 * Two interleaving map() operations should not throw an unexpected error, or force each other to wait,
 * or violate pairwise consistency, but the exact way they must interleave is not specified.

 * given some legal card `c`, f(c) should be a legal replacement card which is consistently 
 * the same every time f(c) is called for that same `c`.
